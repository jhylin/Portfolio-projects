# Portfolio-projects
This repository contains different healthcare and pharmaceutical-related projects from my personal interests, as I came from a pharmacy background initially, so I do still want to delve deeper into these fields with the use of data science and analytics tools.

All of the projects are done by using Python (via Anaconda), SQL (via DBeaver on MySQL server), and also R (via RStudio), which is another programming language I've derived recently.

#### Completed projects:
#### Rare disease drugs 
- Python (Rare disease drugs - approved only.ipynb)
- R with base R version (Rare disease drugs (base R methods).ipynb) and Tidyverse version (Rare_diseases_drugs_RStudio.md) plus graphs in separate file folder with same file name

#### Natural history of rare diseases: malformation syndrome 
- Python (Natural history of rare disease - malformation syndrome.ipynb)

#### Long COVID 
- SQL (Long COVID.sql)
- Tableau [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jennifer.hy.lin/viz/CharacterisinglongCOVID/Riskfactorswithclinicalassociations)

#### Future planned projects (work-in-progress):
* Phenotypes associated with rare diseases
* COVID-19 antivirals in phase 3 clinical trials
