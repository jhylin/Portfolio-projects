# Portfolio-projects
This repository contains different healthcare and pharmaceutical-related projects of personal interests. All of the projects are mainly done by using Python and SQL, with a little bit of R for now (mainly base R methods initially, until I dive into other R packages in the future).

Tableau project is available on: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jennifer.hy.lin/viz/CharacterisinglongCOVID/Riskfactorswithclinicalassociations (in case this may be of interests to anyone)
