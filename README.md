# Portfolio-projects
This repository contains different healthcare and pharmaceutical-related projects of my personal interests. 

All of the projects are done by using Python (via Anaconda), SQL (via DBeaver on MySQL server), and also R (via RStudio), which is another programming language I've derived recently and hoping to continue to improve on (also applies to Python and SQL as well).

In details:
*Rare disease drugs - in both Python & R (base R and Tidyverse version)
*Rare diseases:malformation syndrome - Python

There is also a Tableau project on characterising long COVID that is available on: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jennifer.hy.lin/viz/CharacterisinglongCOVID/Riskfactorswithclinicalassociations
