# Portfolio-projects
This repository contains different healthcare and pharmaceutical-related projects of my personal interests. 

All of the projects are done by using Python (via Anaconda), SQL (via DBeaver on MySQL server), and also R (via RStudio), which is another programming language I've derived recently.

Completed projects:
* Rare disease drugs - Python & R in base R and Tidyverse versions with graphs in separate file folder with same file name
* Natural history of rare diseases: malformation syndrome - Python
* Long COVID - SQL & Tableau [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jennifer.hy.lin/viz/CharacterisinglongCOVID/Riskfactorswithclinicalassociations)

Future planned projects (work-in-progress):
* Phenotypes associated with rare diseases
* COVID-19 antivirals in phase 3 clinical trials
