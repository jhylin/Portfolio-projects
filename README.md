# Portfolio-projects
This repository contains different healthcare and pharmaceutical-related projects from my personal interests, as I've come from a pharmacy background initially, followed by a few years of research (still not an expert yet), so naturally I still want to delve further into these fields by using data science and analytics tools.

All of the projects were done by using Python (via Anaconda), SQL (via DBeaver on MySQL server), and R (via RStudio), which is another programming language I've derived recently.

#### Completed projects:
#### Drugs in rare disease
Blog post [link](https://jhylinportfolio.wordpress.com/portfolio/python-project-rare-disease-drugs/) for background information
- Python (Rare disease drugs - approved only.ipynb)
- R with base R version (Rare disease drugs (base R methods).ipynb) and Tidyverse version (Rare_diseases_drugs_RStudio.md) plus graphs in separate file folder with same file name

#### Natural history of rare diseases: malformation syndrome
Blog post [link](https://jhylinportfolio.wordpress.com/portfolio/python-project-rare-diseases-malformation-syndrome/) for further information
- Python (Natural history of rare disease - malformation syndrome.ipynb)

#### Long COVID 
- SQL (Long COVID.sql), please see blog post [link](https://jhylinportfolio.wordpress.com/portfolio/sql-project-long-covid/) for further information
- Tableau (not in GitHub but please see Tableau Public [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jennifer.hy.lin/viz/CharacterisinglongCOVID/Riskfactorswithclinicalassociations) for dashboards, and blog post [link](https://jhylinportfolio.wordpress.com/portfolio/tableau-project/) for further information)

#### Future planned projects (work-in-progress):
* Phenotypes associated with rare diseases
* COVID-19 antivirals in phase 3 clinical trials

If there are anything that is incorrect, missed or more to be added, please vist [my portfolio blog](https://jhylinportfolio.wordpress.com/project-type/data-analytics/) and leave a comment as I'd love to hear any feedbacks so I can learn and improve (ideally constructive ones please), many thanks.
