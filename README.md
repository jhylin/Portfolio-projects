# Portfolio-projects
This repository contains different healthcare and pharmaceutical-related projects from my personal interests, as I've come from a pharmacy background initially, followed by a few years of research (still not an expert yet), so naturally I still want to delve further into these fields by using data science and analytics tools.

All of the projects were done by using Python (via Anaconda), SQL (via DBeaver on MySQL server), and R (via RStudio), which is another programming language I've derived recently.


#### Completed projects:
#### Drugs in rare disease
Blog post [link](https://jhylin.github.io/Data-analytics-and-research-blog/posts/Drugs%20in%20rare%20diseases/RareDiseasesDrugs.html) for background information
- Python (Rare disease drugs - approved only.ipynb)
- R with base R version (Rare disease drugs (base R methods).ipynb) and Tidyverse version (Rare_diseases_drugs_RStudio.md) plus graphs in separate file folder with same file name

#### Natural history of rare diseases: malformation syndrome
Blog post [link](https://jhylin.github.io/Data-analytics-and-research-blog/posts/Natural%20history%20of%20rare%20diseases%20â€“%20malformation%20syndrome/NaturalHistoryRareDiseasesMalSyn.html) for further information
- Python (Natural history of rare disease - malformation syndrome.ipynb)

#### Long COVID 
- SQL (Long COVID.sql), please see blog post [link](https://jhylin.github.io/Data-analytics-and-research-blog/posts/Long%20COVID%20data%20in%20SQL/LongCOVIDSQL.html) for further information
- Tableau (not in GitHub, please see Tableau Public [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jennifer.hy.lin/viz/CharacterisinglongCOVID/Riskfactorswithclinicalassociations) for dashboards, and blog post [link](https://jhylin.github.io/Data-analytics-and-research-blog/posts/Long%20COVID%20dashboard/TableauDashboard.html) for further information)

#### Phenotypes associated with rare diseases
Four files present:
* .ipynb file shows the initial data cleaning using Python
* .Rmd file shows the actual R codes used to generate the markdown file
* .md file shows the final published format of the project
* .qmd file available in a different repository (Data-analytics-and-research-blog) if anyone's interested

#### Project in the pipeline:
#### Long COVID syndromes
* Aim to look at recent data in 2022
* Data searching stage
